# Matplotlib-challenge
This is the assignment for Module 5, located in the Pymaceuticals folder. 

The folder contains a data subfolder, which includes two data files, and the main.ipynb file, which is the main Jupyter Notebook containing the code. Please make sure that when running this code, your path and the data folder are located at the same level. The file path for importing data is "data/xxx.csv".

**The main.ipynb file already contains the generated results and data plots.**
