# Matplotlib-challenge
This is the assignment for Module 5, located in the Pymaceuticals folder. 

The folder contains the "main.ipynb" file, which is the main Jupyter Notebook code, and a data subfolder, which includes two csv data files. 

Please make sure that when running the main code, your path and the data folder are located at the same level "/Pymaceuticals/". The file path for importing data is "data/xxx.csv".

**The main.ipynb file already contains the generated results and data plots.**
